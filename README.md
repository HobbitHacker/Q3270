A Qt-based 3270 Emulator

"Emulator" is an interesting term. Some refer to these kinds of programs as Simulators, some as
TN3270 Clients, and others use the term Emulator. I use the term Emulator.

Aimed at the IBM mainframe (MVS, OS/390, z/OS, VM, zVM, call it what you will), this
program is intended to be used to access computers running those operating systems, 
via the TN3270 protocol.

It's not (yet) as feature rich as other emulators, but it is (in my limited cases) usuable for
things like MVS 3.8j under Hercules. 

I've used it for at least MVS 3.8j and VM/370.
