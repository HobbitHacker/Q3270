 * @brief
 * Cell represents a single character cell on the display matrix and all the attributes that
 * go with that (underscore, blink and so on).
 *
 * This class is where the colours, visibility and reverse status are set.
 *
 * @param x_pos     -the across position in the 3270 display of this cell
 * @param y_pos    - the down position in the 3270 display of this cell
 * @param x        - the width of the cell in the parent QGraphicRectItem terms
 * @param y        - the height of the cell in the parent QGraphicsRectItem terms
 * @param &cp      - the codepage of the display (there is one codepage for all the display)
 * @param &palette - the colour palette of the display
 * @param *parent  - the parent QGraphicsRectItem (which owns all the Cells)
 * @param *scene   - the scene object
 *
 * @details
 * The scene object is the parent for the overall display, each character and the underscore.
 *
 * Underscores are owned by the scene, as is the character itself (the glyph). The Cell is owned
 * by the 3270 display (24x80 etc) so that the Cell (a QGraphicsRectItem) can have inverted colours
 * which fill the rectangle.
 *
 * The underscore is set at 98% of the height. It is always a single pixel high and is logically
 * the highest layer.
 *
 * Expensive Qt operations (such as changing colours) are only performed once when the incoming
 * datastream has been processed.
 *
 * This is because some 3270 orders cause the display to repeatedly do things - for example, the
 * first "Start Field" order causes all the cells on the screen to have the same value. The next
 * "Start Field" causes all the cells following that until the first "Start Field" is encountered (as
 * the processing wraps around the display). Each "Start Field" therefore processes fewer and fewer
 * locations as the screen fills up with fields.
 *
 * Changing colours each and every time causes noticable delays so instead, when processing the
 * datastream, the updated colour is recorded and a flag set to say that something in this cell
 * has changed.
 *
 * When the datastream is complete, a single call performs the Qt call to updates the colours,
 * reverse, display etc
 *
 * Each Cell contains attributes that are only relevant in particular situations - protection, display, numeric and
 * others can only be set by a Field Start, but given that any cell on the screen can be a field, all cells need to
 * have that potential setting.
